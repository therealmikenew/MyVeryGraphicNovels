            <h2>What's a graphic novel? What's the difference between a graphic novel and comic book?</h2>
            <p>Generally speaking, a graphic novel is one standalone story created with comics content. Comic books are usually serialized with stories that don't have a set completion. But there are great variations to this!</p>

            <h2>Hey, I can't find Superman! Where's Flaming Carrot?! Why can't I find the specific graphic novel I'm looking for?!</h2>
            <p>I'm building this by hand!!! It's a labor of love! I won't have every comic and graphic novel ever made, but I hope to have a robust and exciting collection!</p>
